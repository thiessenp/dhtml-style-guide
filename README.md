# dhtml-style-guide

Here is the original work from the aol.developer work group. Sadly both aol and 
the style guide no longer exist. In effort to capture this work, I found the 
last version from web.archive (see below) and posted it here. If anyone has an 
issue with this feel free to contact me.

This work played an important part in defining Widget behavior later used in the
ARIA spec. I still find it a helpful reference many years later.
